# Predict-stock-price

Stock price predictor machine learning is used to predict tomorrow's stock price by understanding past market data. The model creates a method that predicts the probability that the next day's closing price will increase or decrease. This will help users make financial decisions and determine which stock they want to invest in. We are going to create a model that predicts the change in stock price.

The model will be trained on historical data and then used to predict the next day's closing price. The model uses a variety of features, including historical data from the stock market and its competitors. This information is then used to predict what will happen in the future. The model uses historical stock price data and current market conditions to predict the next day's closing price. The model will then give users a percentage of likelihood that their prediction is correct. Users can input the number of shares they want to buy or sell, along with how much they think it will cost them per share. The model will be able to predict the price of a stock for a specific company and time period. By understanding how the market operates, users can make better decisions about investing in the stock market. This will help them avoid losing money because they didn't understand how the market works. The system will be able to provide users with a list of stocks that may increase or decrease in value. This helps investors make informed decisions and reduce their risk of losing money.
